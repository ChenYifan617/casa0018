# Project Idea

## Title: Your snappy project title

---

## Idea: 
Complete the sentence:

**I want my project to be able to (1)  determines whether people wear masks (2) using the (2) the live camera stream or camera on my (3) Arduino**


1. *e.g. detect when i say "wotcha", recognise a bird in a live camera stream etc*
2. *e.g. camera, microphone, accelerometer etc*
3. *e.g. arduino, laptop, RPi etc*

## Data:
Also think about: 
What data will you use and what data will you capture?
In order to judge whether to wear a mask, I will look for the existing mask Data set and temporarily try to train the model through a total of 400 image Data sets. For the final model, this Data set is too small currently. The data set is divided into two categories, Mask and No Mask. I follow the steps in the TinyML book and the existing examples, upload the data set I found in the Colaboratory, and write the ipynb file to train my model online as CASA0018_2_3_Cats_v_Dogs in the second week.
