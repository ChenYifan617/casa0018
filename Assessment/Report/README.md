# Mask detect on Arduino Nano 33 BLE

name of author

## Introduction
- an overview of what the project does
- your inspiration for making the project 
- examples that it is based on. 
- My project goal is on the Arduino platform achieved the identification of whether wearing masks, specific inspiration is derived from the new GOVID 19 epidemic situation, while existing vaccines, go out with mask is still necessary, but not all the people wear masks. The aim of the project is to make a mask recognition machine and be able to use it anytime and anywhere by cameras 

*probably ~200 words and images are good!*

## Research Question
Tensorflow2.0 was used to build and train the convolutional neural network (CNN) image recognition dicclassification model, and the simplified model was run on the Arduino 33BLE platform, combined with the camera to realize mask recognition.

*probably 1 or 2 sentences*

## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
Data sets of mask recognition cases from several GitHub and some pictures of me and my family have been used to get the pictures of wearing masks and no masks. In general, a total of more than 2000 masks have been collected, including more than 1000 masks worn and unworn respectively. The original data sets have been cleaned, sorted, and stored in two categories respectively, and the pictures have been renamed with serial numbers.The dataset used is shown in the figure show below.

*probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
